1. You need this ML Model REPO: https://github.com/NordAxon/ec-ml-models
- Please clone this to your computer
- Follow its README to create en appropriate Environment

2. You need to create an appropriate Environment - Use requirements.txt in this REPO


# How to start the program
1. step - Start the cloned ML Model's Environment
2. step - Start the ML Model server from the ..\ec-ml-models REPO's DIR in a Terminal:
> python src/main.py

3. step - Start your dedicated Environment for this Program :)
4. step - In your Terminal start our main program:
